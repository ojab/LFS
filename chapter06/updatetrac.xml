  <para>When a new package is released by its maintainers, we mark this in
    Trac. You don't need to update the book right after a package is
    released, but at least announce it.
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>

  <listitem><para>Go to Trac's query page at <ulink
    url="http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/report"/></para>  </listitem>

  <listitem><para>Choose Active Tickets and look for the name of the package.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem><para>Create a new ticket for the new version (as previously
    discussed under entering a new bug). Make it as an enhancement.  Add any
    interesting information, e.g. from the release notes.  When you have put
    in all the information you wish to record, click on <emphasis>Submit ticket
    </emphasis> in the normal way.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem><para>If there is an existing open ticket for a prior version of the
   package, resolve that as <emphasis>wontfix</emphasis> with a note that it has
   been superceded by the new ticket.</para>
