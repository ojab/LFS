  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter shows how to cross-compile basic utilities using
  the just built cross-toolchain. Those utilities are installed into
  their final location, but cannot be used yet. Basic tasks still rely on
  the host's tools. Nevertheless, the installed libraries are used when
  linking.</para>

  <para>Using the utilities will be possible in next chapter after entering
  the <quote>chroot</quote> environment. But all the packages built in the
  present chapter need to be built before we do that. Therefore we cannot be 
  independent of the host system yet.</para>

  <para>Once again, let us recall that improper setting of <envar>LFS</envar>
  together with building as <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>,
  may render your computer unusable.
  This whole chapter must be done as user <systemitem
  class="username">lfs</systemitem>, with the environment as described in
  <xref linkend="ch-preps-settingenviron"/>.</para>
