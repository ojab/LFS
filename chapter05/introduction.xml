  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter shows how to build a cross-compiler and its associated
  tools. Although here cross-compilation is faked, the principles are
  the same as for a real cross-toolchain.</para>

  <para>The programs compiled in this chapter will be installed under the
  <filename class="directory">$LFS/tools</filename> directory to keep them
  separate from the files installed in the following chapters. The libraries,
  on the other hand, are installed into their final place, since they pertain
  to the system we want to build.</para>
