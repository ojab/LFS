  <para>Moving files: One of the (many) complaints against cvs is that it has no
    concept of 1) moving files or 2) versioning directories.  If you need to
    move a file, it's generally better to do it on the server manually. The
    alternative is remove a file using <userinput>cvs delete</userinput> then
    add the new version in the new place with <userinput>cvs add</userinput>.
    The downside using this method is that you will lose the revision history
    for that file. However, moving it on the server itself won't cause a loss of
    revision history.
