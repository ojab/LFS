    <userinput>svn rename</userinput> or <userinput>svn ren</userinput>.
    These commands move files from one location to another. One of the (many)
    complaints against CVS was that it had no
    concept of 1) moving files or 2) versioning directories.  If you needed to
    move a file, it was generally better to do it on the server manually. With
    Subversion, it's all a piece of cake. Note that the changes will only be
    reflected on the Subversion server after you run the <userinput>svn commit</userinput>
    command.</para>
