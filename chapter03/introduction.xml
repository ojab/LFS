  <para>Let's get familiar with the basic set of commands which all editors will
    use on an almost daily basis. There are many more options available than the
    ones listed here, so you will want to read the Subversion documentation
    (<ulink url="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/"/>) at some point.
    <command>svn <option>help</option></command> also provides a useful quick
    reference for Subversion commands.
  </para>

  <para>Some Subversion commands have multiple forms, the canonical command and
    one or more aliases.  We'll list the canonical form and an alias in the
    descriptions.  <command>svn <option>help</option></command> provides a list
    of all Subversion commands with all of their aliases.
