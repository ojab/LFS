  <para>The man and info pages of CVS are fairly good, but let's list a basic
    set of commands which all editors will use on an almost daily basis. There
    are many more options available than the ones listed here, so you will want
    to read the CVS documentation at some point, and run the <userinput>cvs
    --help</userinput> command. You can also get a basic list of CVS commands by
    running <userinput>cvs --help-commands</userinput>
  </para>

  <para>Some commands have two forms, the long and the short. We'll list both in
    the descriptions.
