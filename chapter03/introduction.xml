  <para>Let's get familiar with the basic
    set of commands which all editors will use on an almost daily basis. There
    are many more options available than the ones listed here, so you will want
    to read the Subversion documentation at some point located at
    <ulink url="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/"/>, and run the <userinput>svn
    help</userinput> command.
  </para>

  <para>Some commands have two forms, the long and the short. We'll list both in
    the descriptions.
