<para>The man and info pages of CVS are fairly good, but let's list a basic
set of commands which all editors will use on an almost daily basis. There
are many more options available than the ones listed here, so you will want
to read the CVS documentation at some point, and run the
<userinput>cvs --help</userinput> command. You can also get a basic list
of CVS commands by running <userinput>cvs --help-commands</userinput></para>

<para>Some commands have two forms, the long and the short. We'll
list both in the descriptions.</para>
