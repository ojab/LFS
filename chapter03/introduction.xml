  <para>Let's get familiar with the basic set of commands which all editors will
    use on an almost daily basis. There are many more options available than the
    ones listed here, so you will want to read the Git documentation
    (<ulink url="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git</ulink>) at some
    point.
    <command>git <option>help</option></command> also provides a useful quick
    reference for Git commands. Sometimes <command>git status</command> shows
    a couple of commands that an user might want to run in the current
    state of the repository.

      In addition to the local repository, git maintains a staging area,
      also known as the index. The command <command>git add</command>
      populates that staging area, and <command>git commit</command> is
      used transfer the content of the index to the repository. This
      allows for a fine control of what is committed, but several
      shortcuts can be taken. Note that <command>git add</command> may not
      only be used to add files, but also to store modifications to the
      existing files.
