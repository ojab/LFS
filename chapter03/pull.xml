  <para><userinput>git pull</userinput>.
    This command synchronizes your local repository.
    If you have made local changes, Git will try to
    merge any changes on the server with the changes you have committed
    <emphasis>on your machine</emphasis>. If the changes on the server overlap
    with local uncommitted changes, the merge is cancelled, and the work tree
    untouched.
  </para>

  <para>You should always do a manual <command>git <option>pull</option>
    </command> before trying to push changes in order to ensure that there are
    no conflicts with changes that have been made since you started your work.
    Note that <command>git <option>push</option></command> will warn you if
    there is a conflict, in case you forget to perform an <command>git
    <option>pull</option></command>.
