<para><userinput>cvs delete</userinput> or <userinput>cvs
remove</userinput>. This does what it says: remove (a) file(s) from the
repository on shadowfax. Note that you have to have deleted the file
locally before you can run this. Again, the file will not be deleted from
the server until you do a <userinput>cvs commit</userinput>.</para>
