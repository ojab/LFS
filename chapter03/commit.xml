  <para><userinput>cvs commit</userinput> or <userinput>cvs ci</userinput>. This
    command recursively sends your changes to the CVS server. It will commit
    changed files, added files and deleted files. The -m option can be used to
    pass a log message to the command. If you don't specify a
    <emphasis>-m "MESSAGE"</emphasis>, then it will open the default editor and
    ask you to type in a log. Please don't use empty log messages (see later in
    this document on the policy which governs them).
