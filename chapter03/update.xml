<para><userinput>cvs update</userinput> or <userinput>cvs
up</userinput>. This command syncs your local sandbox with the server and
is probably, along with <userinput>cvs commit</userinput> the command you
will use most frequently. If you have made local changes, it'll try and merge
any changes on the server with your changes
<emphasis>on your machine</emphasis>. You should always do a manual
<userinput>cvs update</userinput> before trying to commit changes in order
to check that everything is alright and ready to go (although when you do a
<userinput>cvs commit</userinput>, it will warn you if there is a
problem).</para>
