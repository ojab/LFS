  <para><userinput>cvs update</userinput> or <userinput>cvs up</userinput>.
    This command syncs your local sandbox with the server and is probably, along
    with <userinput>cvs commit</userinput> the command you will use most
    frequently. If you have made local changes, it'll try and merge any changes
    on the server with your changes <emphasis>on your machine</emphasis>. You
    should always do a manual <userinput>cvs update</userinput> before trying to
    commit changes in order to check that everything is alright and ready to go
    (although when you do a <userinput>cvs commit</userinput>, it will warn you
    if there is a problem).
