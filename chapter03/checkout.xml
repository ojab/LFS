  <para><userinput>cvs checkout</userinput> or <userinput>cvs co</userinput>.
    This command is used to pull a CVS tree such as
    <filename>LFS/BOOK</filename> (the LFS book) or <filename>BLFS</filename>
    (the BLFS book) from the server.  You should only need to do this once. If
    we mess around with the directory structure (as sometimes is necessary),
    you may occasionally need to delete your local sandbox and re-check it out.
    If this is going to be needed, it will usually be because the Editor will
    have made a <emphasis>large</emphasis> change and it'll be announced at
    least on the <filename>lfs-book</filename> list.
