<para><userinput>cvs checkout</userinput> or <userinput>cvs
co</userinput>. This command is used to pull a CVS tree such as
<filename>LFS/BOOK</filename> (the LFS book) or
<filename>BLFS</filename> (the BLFS book) from the server.  You
should only need to do this once. If we mess around with the directory
structure (as sometimes is necessary), you may occasionally need to
delete your local sandbox and re-check it out. If this is going to be
needed, it will usually be because the Editor will have made a
<emphasis>large</emphasis> change and it'll be announced at least on the
<filename>lfs-book</filename> list.</para>
