  <title>Changing Ownership</title>

  <note>
    <para>The commands in the remainder of this book must be performed while
    logged in as user <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> and no
    longer as user <systemitem class="username">lfs</systemitem>. Also, double
    check that <envar>$LFS</envar> is set in <systemitem
    class="username">root</systemitem>'s environment.</para>
  </note>

  <para>Currently, the whole directory hierarchy in <filename
  class="directory">$LFS</filename>
  is owned by the user <systemitem class="username">lfs</systemitem>, a user
  that exists only on the host system. If the directories and files under <filename
  class="directory">$LFS</filename> are kept as they are, they will be
  owned by a user ID without a corresponding account. This is dangerous because
  a user account created later could get this same user ID and would own all
  the files under <filename class="directory">$LFS</filename>, thus exposing
  these files to possible malicious manipulation.</para>

  <para>To address this issue, change the
  ownership of the <filename class="directory">$LFS/*</filename> directories to
  user <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> by running the following
  command:</para>

<screen><userinput>chown -R root:root $LFS/{usr,lib,var,etc,bin,sbin,tools}
case $(uname -m) in
  x86_64) chown -R root:root $LFS/lib64 ;;
esac</userinput></screen>
