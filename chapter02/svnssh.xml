<title>Subversion SSH Access (for editors)</title>
<?dbhtml filename="svnssh.html"?>

<para>For editors, access is slightly more complicated. You first of
all need to generate yourself an ssh key-pair. You then need to upload
your public key into your <filename>~/.ssh</filename> directory on
belgarath. To generate the keys run:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>ssh-keygen -t dsa</userinput></screen></para>

<para>When prompted as to where to save them, it's probably best to leave
them in .ssh (as <filename>id_dsa</filename> and
<filename>id_dsa.pub</filename>) unless you already have ssh keys there.
When prompted for a passphrase just press enter (unless you want to have
to give the phrase <emphasis>every</emphasis> time you perform a cvs
operation.  Having generated your keys, upload
<filename>~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub</filename> to belgarath and move it to
<filename>~/.ssh/authorized_keys2</filename> <emphasis>on
belgarath</emphasis>.  (Your local copy of <filename>id_dsa</filename>
and <filename>id_dsa.pub</filename> should remain untouched by
this.) Make sure that the ~/.ssh directory on belgarath is mode 700:</para>

<screen><userinput>chmod -R 700 ~/.ssh</userinput></screen>

<para>Once you have this setup, try to checkout the latestt LFS book revision by
running:</para>

<screen><userinput>svn co svn+ssh://svn.linuxfromscratch.org/LFS/trunk/BOOK lfs-trunk
</userinput></screen>

<para>If this works, you'll pull the current book into lfs-trunk and you
will have your own local working copy.  You will also have write access so from
now on be extra careful, but note that <emphasis>no</emphasis> changes will be made until
you use a <userinput>svn ci</userinput> command.</para>

<para>As with anonymous access, you can update your local copy by simply
cd'ing into the LFS directory and running:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>svn up</userinput></screen></para>
