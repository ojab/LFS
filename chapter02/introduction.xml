<para>The shadowfax CVS server provides services for all of the *LFS
projects (and some others). The tree which we are interested in for
LFS editing is (unsurprisingly) the LFS tree.  A complete list of the
modules which are available can be found using the cvsweb interface at
<ulink url="http://cvs.linuxfromscratch.org/index.cgi/"/>.</para> 

<para>There are two types of CVS access provided to the LFS tree.
Firstly, there is anonymous read-only access which anyone can use.
Secondly, there is read-write access granted to active editors who have
shadowfax accounts.</para>
