<title>Welcome to the LFS Editor's Manual</title>
<?dbhtml filename="preface.html" dir="preface"?>

<para>This manual will teach you all that you need to know in order to
properly edit the LFS-Book. It will cover some basic issues like accessing
CVS over SSH and the CVS commands you will be used. It will also discuss
the proper sequence of doing things like upgrading a package (both in the
book as well as the FTP server) and how to work with the bug tracking
database.</para>
