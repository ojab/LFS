    <userinput>svn add</userinput> command on each of them (something like
    <userinput>svn add chapter06/kernel*.xml</userinput> will work).</para>

  <para>If you think you're ready to commit, run <userinput>svn status</userinput>
    or <userinput>svn st</userinput> to see what changes the commit will make.</para>
