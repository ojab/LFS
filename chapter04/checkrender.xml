  <title>Check that the book renders properly</title>
  <?dbhtml filename="checkrender.html"?>

  <para>Before commiting any changes, it's important to check that you have all
    the syntax correct and that the book can actually pass through
    <userinput>openjade</userinput> without making it belch.  Instructions on
    how to render the book can be obtained by reading the
    <filename>INSTALL</filename> and <filename>README</filename> files that are
    in the LFS CVS repository. It's generally best to have a script which
    automatically does it all for you. If not better, at least it's easier as
    you don't have to type out the long openjade command all the time.
