  <title>Check that the book renders properly</title>
  <?dbhtml filename="checkrender.html"?>

  <para>Before commiting any changes, it's important to check that you have all
    the syntax correct and that the book can actually pass through
    <command>xsltproc</command> without any problems.  Instructions on how to
    render the book can be obtained by reading the <filename>INSTALL</filename>
    and <filename>README</filename> files that are in the LFS Subversion
    repository.
  </para>

  <para>The <filename>Makefile</filename> that accompanies the XML sources for
    the book have various targets that aid in the rendering of the book.
    Firstly, <command>make <option>validate</option></command> ensures that the
    XML is valid, and that further processing with <command>xsltproc</command>
    won't fail.  This target was added because rendering the full book into HTML
    or PDF can take some time.  The most common cause of rendering failures is
    because of invalid XML, hence this target was added as a time-saving
    measure. Secondly, <command>make</command> will render the HTML output.
    Finally, <command>make <option>pdf</option></command> will render the PDF
    output.
