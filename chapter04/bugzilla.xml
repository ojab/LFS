<para>The final part of updating the book is to update bugzilla. This is
usually as easy as going to LFS Bugzilla (<ulink
url="http://bugs.linuxfromscratch.org"/>), going to the bug and
choosing Resolve bug, changing resolution to FIXED.  Note that you
should <emphasis>not</emphasis> then go back and CLOSE the bug.  The
person who closes the bug should be a different editor who has tested
that what the bug is about has been fixed. Basically, it's our QA
process.</para>

<para>A more detailed explanation on how to use Bugzilla can be found
later. This is just the check-list (ie: don't forget to finish off with
Bugzilla assuming you already know how to use it).</para>
