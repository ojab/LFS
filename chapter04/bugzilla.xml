  <para>The final part of updating the book is to update bugzilla. This is
    usually as easy as going to LFS Bugzilla (<ulink
    url="http://bugs.linuxfromscratch.org"/>), going to the bug and choosing
    Resolve bug, changing resolution to FIXED.  Note that you should
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> then go back and CLOSE the bug.  The person who
    closes the bug should be a different editor who has tested that what the bug
    is about has been fixed. Basically, it's our QA process.
  </para>

  <para>A more detailed explanation on how to use Bugzilla can be found later.
    This is just the check-list (ie: don't forget to finish off with Bugzilla
    assuming you already know how to use it).
