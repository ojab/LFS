<para>Once you are sure that everything renders and that you know which
files you wish to commit, you're ready. A transaction log of the CVS commit
will be emailed to the <userinput>lfs-book</userinput> mailinglist so we
all can see right away what you did. The commit emails contain some basic
info (log, changes to which files) including a <emphasis>diff -u</emphasis>
format output.</para>

<para>Before you actually commit, spend two seconds thinking about the
log you are going to add. As mentioned in the section on CVS
commands, comments should <emphasis>always</emphasis> be used when
commiting to CVS. Even if the comment is just 'small typo fix', that'll
do. Other usual comments are 'update to package-x.y.z' or 'fixed
installation instructions of package foo'.</para>

<para>To commit, you use the <userinput>cvs commit</userinput> or
<userinput>cvs ci</userinput> command. A good example of a commit
command could be:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cvs ci -m "Fixed typo in chapter 05/bash-inst.xml" \
index.xml chapter01/changelog.xml chapter05/bash-inst.xml</userinput></screen></para>

<para>If you have only made the changes regarding this package to your tree,
then you can save time by simply running the following from the root of
your local LFS sandbox:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cvs ci -m "Fixed typo in chapter05/bash-inst.xml"</userinput></screen></para>

<para>The first command is more useful when you've modified files you don't
want to commit at this time, or which require a different log message (for
example a fix to chapter05/binutils-exp.xml).</para>
