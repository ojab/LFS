<para>Once you are sure that everything renders and that you know which
files you wish to commit, you're ready. A transaction log of the Subversion commit
will be emailed to the <userinput>lfs-book</userinput> mailinglist so we
all can see right away what you did. The commit emails contain some basic
info (log, changes to which files) including a <emphasis>diff</emphasis>
format output.</para>

<para>Before you actually commit, spend two seconds thinking about the
log you are going to add. As mentioned in the section on Subversion
commands, comments should <emphasis>always</emphasis> be used when
commiting to the repository. Even if the comment is just 'small typo fix',
that'll do. Other usual comments are 'update to package-x.y.z' or 'fixed
installation instructions of package foo'.</para>

<para>To commit, you use the <userinput>svn commit</userinput> or
<userinput>svn ci</userinput> command. A good example of a commit
command could be:</para>

<screen><userinput>svn ci -m "Fixed typo in chapter 05/bash-inst.xml" \
index.xml chapter01/changelog.xml chapter05/bash-inst.xml</userinput></screen>

<para>If you have only made the changes regarding this package to your tree,
then you can save time by simply running the following from the root of
your local LFS working copy:</para>

<screen><userinput>svn ci -m "Fixed typo in chapter05/bash-inst.xml"</userinput></screen>

<para>The first command is more useful when you've modified files you don't
want to commit at this time, or which require a different log message (for
example a fix to chapter05/binutils-exp.xml).</para>
