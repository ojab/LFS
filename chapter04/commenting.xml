<title>Commenting something out</title>
<?dbhtml filename="commenting.html"?>

<para>Sometimes, a change will make something no longer appropriate, but you
think that it might be needed in the future.  If you comment it out in the
normal way, and start the comment with a <literal>FIXME:</literal> marker, that
will be highlighted whenever the file is edited, at least if you use vim.</para>

<para>If you encounter a <emphasis>FIXME:</emphasis> in a comment, do not
automatically assume that it can be deleted because the following instructions
have now been commented out.</para>

<para>Note that there is no example here - the rendering of html strips out
comments, and an empty box looks silly.  As always, render your local copy after
you comment something out, so that you can see the result!</para>
